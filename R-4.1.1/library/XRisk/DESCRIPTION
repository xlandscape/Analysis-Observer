Description: XRisk provides means of accessing data stored by Xplicit data 
    providers in R. Currently, the HDF5-based x3df format is supported and 
    data loaded from there can be aggregated over scales and in chunks, 
    allowing large volumes to be processed in R. XRisk does also allow to 
    define statistical populations and apply functions by these statistical 
    populations on data in R data.tables. Finally, XRisk contains helper 
    functions to read and write spatial and tabular data.
